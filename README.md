# The Christmas Tree Problem

In this paper, written by me as a Junior in high school, I explore two different derivations of a formula for the length of a conical helix wrapped *n* times around a cone of base radius, *r*, and height, *h*. These proofs differ in their use of three dimensional coordinate system. More details can be found in the **Abstract** of the PDF.

Included are the PDF, the .tex file necessary to generate the PDF, the .bib file containing the references, and a folder of images that are referenced in the .tex file. The .blend ([Blender 3D](https://www.blender.org/)) used to generate the images in the folder is also included in the Blender folder.
